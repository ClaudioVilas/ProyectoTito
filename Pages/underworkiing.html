                Terms and Conditions of Use
                These Terms and Conditions of Use (the "Terms") govern the use of our hourly staffing
                application (the "Application") and the services offered on it. By accessing or using the
                Application, you agree to be bound by these Terms and to comply with all applicable laws and
                regulations. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Application.
                1. Description of Service
                The Application allows users (the "Users") to connect with workers willing to perform hourly
                work, as well as with employers looking to hire hourly personnel. The Application does not
                directly or indirectly make hires, but rather offers a connection service between Users looking for
                work and employers looking to hire personnel. The application is not responsible for the hiring or
                payment of workers' salaries.
                The application does not guarantee the availability of jobs or their quality. It is the responsibility
                of the user to evaluate and accept any job offered by a company. The application also does not
                guarantee the availability of workers and it is the responsibility of employers to evaluate and
                accept any worker.
                2. Registration and User Account
                To use the Application, you must create a user account by registering your name, email address,
                and a password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and
                password and for restricting access to your device. You agree to assume responsibility for all
                activities that occur under your account or password.
                3. Veracity of Data
                The application does not verify user information and is not responsible for any lack of veracity in
                the information provided by users. Users must provide true and accurate information in their
                profile and in their communications with companies.
                4. Use Restrictions

                must comply with applicable labor and tax laws in the United States.
                The Application cannot be used for illegal or unauthorized purposes. You cannot use the
                Application in a way that can damage, disable, overburden, or impair the Application or interfere
                with the use and enjoyment of the Application by other users.
                The application reserves the right to remove any profile or communication that contains false,
                offensive, or inappropriate information.
                5. Responsibility of the User
                You are solely responsible for your conduct and all content that you post, send, or share through
                the Application. By using the Application, you agree to comply with all applicable laws, including
                copyright and intellectual property laws.
                Use of the application implies acceptance of these terms and conditions of use.
                You understand and agree that the Application does not make personnel hires and that any
                agreement or contract between Users of the Application and employers is the exclusive
                responsibility of the Users and employers involved, and that the Application will not be
                responsible for any obligation or liability arising from such agreements or contracts.
                Companies that use the application must comply with all applicable labor and tax laws in the
                United States.
                Companies must provide a safe and healthy work environment for workers hired through the

                BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
